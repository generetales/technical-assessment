# Technical Assesstment

This single-page ReactJS application was created as part of a technical assessment for a Frontend Software Developer position to join the development team at Superloop.

## Prerequisite

1. Node.js >= v18
2. Install dependencies `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Country Information List Page

This single-page ReactJS application includes a list page that displays a set of countries based on the search keyword, along with basic information and attributes for the selected result.

To enhance the user experience and optimize resource usage especially when handling large datasets, I implemented pagination. This approach ensures faster load times and provides users with better navigation control.

I did not focus on the visual design, as in a real-world project, UI designs would typically be provided by a dedicated designer.
